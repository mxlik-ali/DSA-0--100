# DSA- 0->100
# 📘 DSA Notes by Mohammed Ali Malik

Welcome to my personal collection of **handwritten DSA notes**, created while following [Striver's A2Z DSA Roadmap](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) (TakeUForward).

This repository is part of a weekly release initiative where I’ll be sharing one DSA topic at a time — building a complete, structured set of revision notes that scale from **absolute beginner level to advanced**.

- 📚 One DSA topic released every week (Arrays, Strings, Hashing, etc.)
